JAvascript and Jquery - a love story.

<p>
Well, now it's time for the fun part. I finally get to flex my programming ability. Here we go.
</br>

</p>

<h2> LEARNING POINTS </h2>

<p>

Oh jeez that was much more difficult than what I had originally assumed. A simple calculator app causing such a headache; i never would have thought simple numbers would betray me in the end. 

</br>
My satisfaction after completing this mini project is very lack luster, mostly because I know I could have done much better. The calculator itself is very ugly, and the implementation is arguably worse. I got through half of the implementation and realized there were a whole ton of cases I hadn't even considered. I basically had to hack and slash through my abysmal code base in order to even get a semi functional version in operation. 

</br>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The hardest part was trying to figure out how to work out the logic in the "backend" of the application.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>I definitely should plan my structure before I begin coding. Otherwise I dig myself a hole.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3> SOME NOTES DURING WORKING. </h3>
</br>
initializing a variable in javascript. Since there are no types, when i initialize an integer, it gets initialized as undefined or nullÉ is there any erason i shouldnèt just assign it a default value of 90É
</br>
jquery is too useful. being able to select elements with a $ is a godsend.
</br>
javascript for e in x is different than in python. threw me for a ..... LOOP :).
</br>
parseInt on an operation such as "-" and "+"????
</br>
and operator.. if and else... switch... for loops...
/* I was taling about how i had to google all of these simple syntax */
</br>

</p>
<h3> TIME SPENT </h3>

<p style = "font-size: 25px">
 2.5 hrs spent. A big chunk of that, probably an hour or so was just trying to fix the bugs that I myself had created. I sepent a majority of the time googling how to do simple jquery dom manipulation as well as looking up simple javascript knowledge.
