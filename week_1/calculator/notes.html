After dilly daddling for the better part of three months, I decided it was now time to get myself together and start learning. For real this time. I had wanted to get my hands wet and slimy by dealing with javascript for a while now, and I finallly got the motivation to start building. I had read 'Wrox Professional Javascript For Web Developers' a couple of months ago, and after getting through perhaps 2/3rds of the book, I decided that wass enough syntax memorization for a lifetime. Now, I was able to applly what I had learned from my years of school as well as the spattering of learning I recieved online to actually create something on the web that had a purpose. Grated, it is just a simple calculator app, but all great things start somewhere.

<h2> LEARNING POINTS </h2>

Alright, I think I'm just going to do the CSS portion today. The layout for building even a simple calculator app is much more difficult then previously expected. That being said, I don't expect to work that much with css in the future, and today will probably be one of the few days where I devote my "programming time" for something so asinine and rudimentary. I was excited to move on to javascript, but there are again unique challenges. I've selected html elements using jquery and basic javascript before, and I'm sure that once I get in the thick of things, I will be able to finish off the application. I predict one more hour until I have a minimum viable product.

The hardest part today was trying to put the numbers inside the divs. It took an obscene amount of time for me to figure out how position: absolute works and how the divs and elements inside the divs interact with each other. I'm not fully convinced I understand the material perfectly, but I have enough of a baseline with CSS now that I'm sure I will perform better in the future.

Initiially, I was going to design the whole calculator myself. After about thirty minutes to an hour, I gave up, and looked up on stack overflow how to position div's correctly. The awkward position of the equals sign as well as the 0 , + , and - speak to that sentiment. I got a little bit tired of messing around with layout near the end and while I'm decently happy with the result, it ofcourse could be improved.
