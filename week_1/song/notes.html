<h1>
Here Comes That Talent

</h1>
<div> 
<h3> January 20th, 2017
</h3>
<p> There comes a time in every mans life where he realizes he has talents that he never knew he had. For me, this has been music. Ofcourse, I don't realy think I'm a good singer quite yet but rather that I enjoy it just as how I enjoy writing and programming. It gives me profound joy to be able to mix all three of my core interests together into what I like to call kevincolour.com/home/projects.

<p> Unfortuantely the syncing didn't quite work as I expected it to. It was synced pretty much perfectly in the audio editing program I used but when I took each of the seperate tracks and had javascript play them one after another , the sync is noticibly bad. I conclude that javascript takes substantial processing time to execute audiofile.play().

<h2> LEARNING POINTS </h2>

<p> LEt's be honest, there is not gonig to be a whole lot of learning poitns here. I learned that audio is stupidly easy to embed in a website and that html has a specific tag for it. Other then that... I'm stil having trouble trying to center div's on a page. I'm getting more and more frustrated with css the longer I work with it. I was going to make all the ubttons more centralized, but I realized it was not wroth my time after ten minutes or so. I also had a lot more ideas if the sync would work... alas.

</p>

<p>
My satisfaction after completing this mini project was low. Syncing the artist's voice and my voice was pretty fun, but that has very little to do with programming. It was fun to attempt, but alas.</p>

 2.5 hrs spent. I sepent a majority of the time figuring out syntax and messing around. I also spent a little bit of time working on the sync.
