<h1> HOW TO PLAY </h1>

<p>  The Objective of the game is to guess the 4 digit, randomly generated number (the ANSWER) by guessing repeatedly. </p>
<p> There are couple of rules to this game to help you achieve the Objective.  </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	The random genrated number(the ANSWER) does not have repeat digits. IE 0033 is NOT a valid number. 0123 is valid. 2301 is valid. 
	</li>
	<li>
	You must guess only 4 digits at a time.
	</li>
	<li>
	If one of the digits in the number you provide matches the ANSWER, then a B is shown. If the ANSWER is 1234 and you guess 4321, there will be 4 "B"s.
	</li>
	<li>
	If one of the digits in the number you provide is in the same column as the ANSWER, then a S is shown. If the ANSWER is 1234 and you guess 1243, there will be an output of "SSBB".
	</li>
</ul>
<p> Good luck, and have fun. I used to play this game with my family when on vacations. We averaged around 10 guesses to find the answer. </p>
<p> p.s. console.log shows the answer :) </p>
