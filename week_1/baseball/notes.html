<h1>
The Joy of not having to mess with CSS/HTML

</h1>
<div> 
<h3> January 18th, 2017
</h3>
<p>
IT';s the simple things in life. Some people enjoy a nice, steaming cup of coffe. Others enjoy long walks on the beach. I enjoy not having to touch html and css. TI'm writing this after I finished ths simple app that I had wanted to do for a better part of a yaer. My family and I had countless hours of fun competing vs each other and taking turns being the "computer". They had wanted me to make this app for moblie devices because they were certain it would be the newest hit. I disagreed, but I knew that it would be a good starting project for when I finally decided to start on some personal projects. I was not wrong. Writing this was a blast almost from start to finish. It aws a smooth ride, but I felt at least a little challenged during it. All in all, it was a good time.
</br>

</p>

<h2> LEARNING POINTS </h2>

<p>
Not as much learning done when compared to the calculator app. The only new thing I had to google was indexOf and besides that, it was all very basic. There was a simliar problem of converting integers to strings and strings to integers that i experienced while making the calculator. This time, i was much better preprared to tackle the challenge.

</p>

</br>
My satisfaction after completing this mini project was very high. This basically felt like a rward after strggling through the calculator app yesterady, since many of the same concepts are used in both proejcts. 

</br>
<h3> SOME NOTES DURING WORKING. </h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>implicit conversion when adding an 'int' value to an empty string.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>not choosing how to use functions correctly. there should be no actual code in docuemnt.ready</p>
	</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3> TIME SPENT </h3>
